RF02929 - sub-alignments of the most distant sequences of the RF02929 family (depths: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80)

Rfam14.9 - the Rfam14.9 dataset of 4108 alignments in Fasta, Stockholm, and Clustal formats

RfamPDB - the RfamPDB dataset of 134 alignments of Rfam families having at least one known 3D structure in PDB (Fasta + Stockholm + Clustal)

RNAStralignExt - the RNAStralignExt dataset of 11 Rfam families

S01Ali - the S01 dataset of 24 sequences along with multiple sequence alignments and shape data. "shape1.5" sub-folder lists raw SHAPE data from the ShapeKnots publication (range from 0.0 to 1.5 with a number of outliers, 
"shape2.0" sub-folder lists normalized SHAPE data ranged from 0.0 to 2.0 with truncated outliers; missing values are set to -999 in both folders. "afa" folder includes normalized SHAPE data ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 with missing values set to 0.5 and truncated outliers.
Reference sequence gap columns are preserved.

S01Aliclean - the S01 dataset along with multiple sequence alignments. Reference sequence gap columns are preserved

S01Ali_init - intermediate files used to build the S01Ali dataset (with BlastN-derived alignments)

S01AliUngap - the S01Ali dataset with the reference sequence gap columns removed

S01AliUngapclean - the S01Aliclean dataset with the reference sequence gap columns removed

SeqSim - the SeqSim dataset (11 RNAStralignExt families vs. ~50 alignments of depth 5, 10, and 20)

SubAli - the SubAli dataset (11 RNAStralignExt families vs. 11 depths vs 10 alignments)

S01.fas - the S01 dataset with normalized SHAPE data (from 0.0 to 1.0, truncated outliers, missing values set to 0.5)

S01_200.fas - subset of the S01 dataset involving 14 sequences shorter than 200 nts

S01raw.fas - the S01 dataset with raw SHAPE data (from 0.0 to 1.5 with outliers; missing values set to 0.5)

SRtrain.fas - the SRtrain dataset of 274 sequences

SRtrain150.fas - the subset of SRtrain dataset involving 266 sequences shorter than 150 nts

SRtrain150NL.fas - the SRtrain150 dataset with lone pairs removed

SRtrainNL.fas - the SRtrain dataset with lone pairs removed

TS1reducedWC.fas - the TS1reducedWC dataset from the SPOT-RNA publication. The dataset includes 62 of the 67 sequences of the TS1 dataset, with 5 sequences removed
due to having modified bases. The reference structures include only WC (GC/AU) and WB (GU) base pairs.

TS1reducedWCNL.fas - the TS1reducedWC dataset with lone pairs removed
